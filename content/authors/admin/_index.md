I am a **PhD candidate** within the [GIScience group](http://www.geographie.uni-jena.de/Geoinformatik_p_1558.html) at the [Department of Geography](http://www.geographie.uni-jena.de/Institut+f√ºr+Geographie.html). 
I focus on the application of statistical- and machine learning techniques to address research questions related to environmental issues.  

At the same time I am working for the [Department of Statistics](http://www.compstat.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/) at LMU Munich to develop the R package framework [mlr3](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3).
Currently I also maintain the [mlr](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr) package.

Besides the scientific part my interests lie in the development of programming solutions to simplify todays data science challenges. 
I am working in a reproducible manner and actively working on promoting the idea of reproducible research in science.
I like to [**write**]({{< relref "#posts" >}}) about the Linux world, the R programming world and other technical topics that I find interesting.
