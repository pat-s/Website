I am an R consultant working in Zurich, CH.
My area of expertise is is in the area of applied machine learning, more specifically in the field of environmental modeling.
I am also familiar with DevOps applications (Docker, Terraform, Ansible).
Besides, I am also undertaking a PhD at the [GIScience group](https://www.geographie.uni-jena.de/Geoinformatik_p_1558.html) at the [Department of Geography](https://www.geographie.uni-jena.de/Institut+f√ºr+Geographie.html) at [University of Jena](https://www.uni-jena.de/en/) related to environmental modeling.

In my spare time I like to develop programmatic solutions to simplify todays data science challenges.
My standard is to work in a reproducible manner and also actively promote this philosophy in my daily work.
Furthermore I enjoy [**writing**]({{< relref "#posts" >}}) about the Linux world, the #rstats community and other technical topics that I find interesting.
